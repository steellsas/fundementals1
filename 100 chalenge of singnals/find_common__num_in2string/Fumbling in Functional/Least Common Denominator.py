# You need to sum up a bunch of fractions that have different denominators.
# In order to do this, you need to find the least common denominator of all the fractions.
# As a professional programmer, you know that the least common denominator is in fact their LCM.
#
# For the given list of denominators, find the least common denominator by finding their LCM.
#
# Example
#
# For denominators = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the output should be
# leastCommonDenominator(denominators) = 60.
a= 8
b = 90
tt=  a % b
